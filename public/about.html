<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a German-speaking Frontend Developer with experience in building web apps
  with JavaScript & Angular based in Leverkusen. Before I started my journey as
  a developer I worked as IT EDI Administrator. My main tasks there have been
  Implementation, administration and maintenance of EDI IT systems. After trying
  out a few small exercises myself, I decided to get professional training. A
  decision that I have never regretted. As a web developer with a focus on
  design of web applications and websites, my professional career has been
  characterised by determination and adaptability.

<p>
  The intention for continuous development ensures that I am always staying up
  to date with technology and finding innovative solutions for diverse
  challenges. With my proactive and committed approach, I specifically use these
  skills to not only complete complex projects on time, but also to maintain the
  highest quality standards.
</p>

<p>
  My enthusiasm for software development goes beyond the technical aspects. It
  fills me with joy to accompany people on their way to realising their
  projects. I am looking forward to applying this passion as a Junior Developer
  in a new professional environment.
